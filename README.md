### Aim
Classification problem : To predict whether an individual makes more than 50000

Important Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Normalization
3. Model training
4. Model optimising

Evaluation metric used is fbeta score. Few important features are selected

#### Summary
Three models were compared (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest). Random Forest model is further optimized using GridsearchCV

Final accuracy score on the test data : .8577
Final f_score on the test data : .7288
